(1+1)-CMA-ES for Constrained Optimization 
==========================================

This strategy is proposed in "A (1+1)-CMA-ES for Constrained Optimisation" by Dirk V. Arnold and Nikolaus Hansen, see Paper_. It is based on the underlying Cholesky-(1+1)-CMA-ES and extended by constraint vectors which approximate linear constraint boundaries.
