Understanding the ASK/TELL Pattern
----------------------------------
Besides, the architecture is based on the original ASK/TELL optimization pattern by Collette, Y., N. Hansen, G. Pujol, D. Salazar Aponte and R. Le Riche, see [4]_. Further, this approach has been extended to suit constrained optimization. The project, with its implementations of the various algorithms, is licensed under the Free Software License GPLv3.
