# evopy

This project is experimental software. Furthermore the code is intended for researchers. Feel free to contribute!

## Features
 
* ASK/TELL-pattern for (constrained) optimization 
* 6 different uni-modal test problems with a linear constraint (e.g. TR problem)
* Implementation of DSES, CMA-ES with Death Penalty for constraint optimization 
* SVC surrogate model strategies
